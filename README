FreeBSD Stopgap Installer
=========================
Nathan Whitehorn
January 8, 2010

This is designed to be a lightweight replacement for sysinstall until future
installers show up, but more modular and easily extended. It is scriptable
from shell scripts. The full installer can be run by executing bsdinstall auto,
and is intended to be run from a live environment (e.g. a live CD or PXE boot).
bsdinstall must be in PATH. In addition to base tools, Thomas Dickey's new
dialog must be installed (devel/cdialog).

Status:
- Installs working, bootable systems on powerpc, amd64, i386, and sparc64

Missing features:
- Distfile fetching not entirely hooked up

Goals:
- Reinvent as few wheels as possible
- Extensibility
- Scriptability without a scripting language -- the installer itself should
  be a script a user can modify
- Minimal grubbing around in outputs of shell commands with awk, sed, etc.
