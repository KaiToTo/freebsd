$FreeBSD$

This is the FreeBSD kernel stress test suite. The purpose is to crash the
computer, by stressing selected parts of the kernel, thus exposing inadequate
error handling.

Do not run the syscall test as root.

To build and use:

make
sh ./run.sh

The "run.sh" script accepts an optional configuration file in order to test specific areas.
For example:

./run.sh vfs.sh


To run all of the different test scenarios type:

./run.sh -a

You may have to tune the stress test to make sure that your test box run low
on resources.  For example:

INCARNATIONS=125 ./run.sh

The following sub-directories exists:

./doc		Documentation
./include	Include file for building the test programs in ./testcases
./lib		Common support files for the test programs
./misc		Various test scenarios. Mostly regression tests
./testcases	Test programs
./tools		Supplementary tools used in stress testing

The name stress2 indicates that this is the second generation of the Kernel Stress Test Suite.
The first version (stress) was based mostly on scripts.
